# pinterestbots
A fully-fledged Pinterest bot capable of creating and managing any number of accounts. Capabilities to message users through the Pinterest private API that I reverse engineered (all that is needed is the account that is sending the DM's login cookie). Please do not use this bot for malicious purposes, this is to demonstrate my programming skills, not to cause damage to Pinterest.
